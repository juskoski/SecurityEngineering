# Task 3: Company Security Policy

# Password Policy
### General Guidelines for Passwords

When a new employee is enrolled, their account’s initial password shall be generated using a common password generator tool such as pwgen on Linux (be sure to use the --secure option). The generated password must be 16 characters long and it must be changed upon first logon.

The owner of the account gets to choose their own password; the only restriction is that the password must be 8-64 characters long. General advice is that the password should not contain words in their default form (i.e., in the form they are found in dictionary) or alternatively some words may be intentionally misspelled (backpack -> bakcpakc) in order to prevent dictionary attacks.

Under certain circumstances, such as complying with standards, we may require a password to contain both upper and lower-case letters, special characters and numbers. We may implement a blocklist of commonly used words, numbers and patterns.

### No-No's

To keep the password safe, there are few things the account’s owner must consider:
- Re-using old passwords is prohibited
- Sharing your password with anyone is prohibited
- Storing your password elsewhere than company provided software or hardware is prohibited

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Users are required to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access their accounts and devices. The login process will check for the following:
- Something the user knows (password, PIN-code)
- Something the user is (biometric, such as fingerprint or face recognition)
- Something the user has (device, such as phone with authenticator app or a hardware authenticator device)
- Time
- Location

If a successful login attempt occurs at an unexpected time, location or network, the account will be automatically locked until further investigation.

### Changing Password

We do not encourage changing passwords regularly. However, under certain situations, such as complying with standards, we may enforce 90-day password expiration.

Passwords must be changed immediately if it is suspected that it has been compromised. During the password changing process, the user must inform the reason for the password change (e.g. forgot old password, accidentally compromising it, or someone might've shoulder surfed and seen the password).

# Physical Access Policy

### Access to Company's Premises
Only the company's employees and subcontractors, invited guests, auditors, the building's service personnel and emergency service personnel shall be granted access into the company's premises.

Direct employees and subcontractors must have their identification badges visible at all times. If an employee does not have their identification badge, it may be pardoned once in a set period if at least two other direct collegues with an identification badge recognises the person.

Service personnel (cleaners, janitors etc.) must have a guest badge and an escort with them at all times if they require access to restricted areas (server rooms, research labs etc.). They may complete their duties freely without an escort in common areas, such as break rooms, toilets and corridors.

Guests (customers, auditors) must be booked at least a day in advance and their precense must be announced to others via an email list. Guests must have a guest badge visible and have an escort at all times. If they require access to restricted areas, it must be booked separately at least a week in advance.

Personnel without valid identification must be questioned and removed immediately from the premise. If a crime is suspected (including trespassing), the law enforcment must be contacted immediately. All incidents shall be reported to administration.

### Door policy
All doors leading into restricted areas (e.g. doors leading into the premise, server rooms, research laboratories etc.) must remain locked at all times. They must be unlockable with the personal idenfitication badge, if the personnel has the required permission level to access the restricted area. Only one person may use the door at a time. Holding the door open for others than direct collegues is prohibited. For emergency reasons, the door must be unlockable from inside and the doors must be unlockable remotely.

### Access to Company's Devices
Only the employees has the right to access and use company's devices. Personal work devices, such as laptops and phones, may only be accessed by their assigned employee, or by administrators and the IT-department, if they have a valid reason.

### Surveillance Systems
In case of incidents occuring, there have been some of the following surveillance systems installed in the company's premises:
- Surveillance cameras
- Door access logging
- Fingerprint readers
- Security guards
- Motion sensors
- Variety of alarms (burglar, fire, etc.)
