# Task 1: What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes?

I follow multiple news sources to keep myself informed on what's going on in the cybersecurity field.
I've subscribed to the NCSC email list, I read news daily (bleepingcomputer, the hacker news, WSL),
and listen to podcasts (herrasmieshakkerit, darknet diares) to name a few ways. I train my skills
on online platforms, such as HackTheBox to hone my technical skills.

Recently, I have started going passwordless (wherever possible) and switched to using a password manager.
Instead of having a single email to serve as a "single point of failure", I've created multiple email addresses
for diffent purposes. When purchasing new devices, I research the manufacturer to be sure they are responsible and
offer long-term support. Maintaining updates is hard work, so I've created scheduled tasks/jobs to automatically check
for updates on my machines. And in case of my machine gets infected with malware and everything has to be wiped,
I've created scripts and "plays" to setup a baseline for my machines using Ansible.

I am a "victim" of couple of data breaches. Honestly, I don't think there is much individuals can do to prevent these
as it's ultimately up to the service providers to make sure their systems are secure. I guess one must stay mindful
about the services they use, what information the service collects, and the possibility of said data becoming public.
